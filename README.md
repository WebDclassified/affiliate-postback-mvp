Affiliate Postback MVP
This project is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of an affiliate marketing system that uses Server-to-Server (S2S) postback tracking for conversions. Instead of relying on client-side cookies, this system tracks conversions through direct communication between servers, which is more reliable and secure.

‚ú® Features
Click Tracking: An endpoint to record affiliate clicks with a unique click_id.

Postback Endpoint: A secure endpoint that receives and validates conversion notifications from an advertiser's server.

Affiliate Dashboard: A frontend application that displays an affiliate's clicks and conversions.

Unique Postback URL Generation: The dashboard shows a unique, personalized postback URL format for each affiliate.

üöÄ Local Development Setup
To run this project locally, you need to set up both the backend and frontend.

Prerequisites
Node.js & npm: Download and install Node.js (LTS).

PostgreSQL: A running instance of PostgreSQL (locally or hosted online).

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your database connection string.

PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL="postgres://your_user:your_password@your_host:your_port/your_database_name"
Initialize the database: Run the setup script to create the necessary tables and seed initial data.

Bash

node setup.js
Start the backend server:

Bash

node server.js
The server will run on http://localhost:3001.

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the frontend server:

Bash

npm run dev
The affiliate dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000.

‚û°Ô∏è Example API Endpoints
You can use a tool like Postman or curl to test the backend endpoints.

1. Track a Click (GET)
This endpoint simulates a user clicking an affiliate link. A unique click_id is required.

Bash

curl "http://localhost:3001/click?affiliate_id=1&campaign_id=1&click_id=test_click_001"
Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Click tracked"}

2. Send a Postback (GET)
This endpoint simulates an advertiser sending a conversion notification. The click_id must match a click that was previously tracked.

Bash

curl "http://localhost:3001/postback?affiliate_id=1&click_id=test_click_001&amount=50.00&currency=USD"
Response: {"status": "success", "message": "Conversion tracked"}

3. Fetch All Affiliates (GET)
This is used by the frontend for the dashboard's "login simulation."

Bash

curl "http://localhost:3001/api/affiliates"
Response: [{"id":1,"name":"Affiliate A"}, {"id":2,"name":"Affiliate B"}]

4. Fetch Affiliate Dashboard Data (GET)
This provides all clicks and conversions for a specific affiliate ID.

Bash

curl "http://localhost:3001/api/affiliate/1"
Response: An object containing clicks and conversions arrays.
